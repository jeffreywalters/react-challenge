# React-Challenge

An example react application with react-router routes, async redux reducers, async data fetching, redux-form with validation, and more.

#### Motivation
I originally started this application for a job application challenge. (I got the job) I've since updated it when I've wanted to try something new or something has inspired me.

#### Under the Hood
 - [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
 - [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
 - [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) 3.0
 - [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) for meta tags by the NFL
 - [Redial](https://github.com/markdalgleish/redial) for data fetching by [@markdalgleish](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish)
 - [Babel 6](https://github.com/babel/babel)
 - [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)

### Getting started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeffreywalters/react-challenge.git MyApp
cd MyApp

```
